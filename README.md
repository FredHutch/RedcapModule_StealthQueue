# module-hide-homepage-emails
This module sends REDCap's survey queue under cover. When employed, survey queue will function normally but will work silently and invisibly. And the REDCap user will not know it is there.

**Notes**: 
1. You must enable auto-start on all surveys in order for this module to work correctly.
2. Do not enable this module where you wish for users to be aware of survey queue or where you need for them to start surveys at their option.
